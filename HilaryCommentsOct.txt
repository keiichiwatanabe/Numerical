Great start.

Your git commit messages should describe the changes you have made.

Use a .gitignore file so that you do not sotre .pyc or .pdf files in the repository.

Change the name of the file from "changeThisName.pdf".

What does "CIP" stand for? The doc-string says semi-Lagrangian but the code doesn't look like semi-Lagrangian.

I am surprised that the CIP scheme needs dx.


I don't know what the formula should be for CIP but yours is dimensioanlly inconsistent with dx in some terms on both the top and the bottom.

Use c**2 and c**3 instead of c*c and c*c*c

Stick to the coding guidelines at
https://www.dropbox.com/s/yba7pj7woyvv7hs/goodCode.pdf
and in particular keep your lines less than 80 characters.

In your code:
        for j in range(nx):
            phi[j] = phiOld[j] - c*\
                     (phiOld[j%nx] - phiOld[(j-1)%nx])

you don't need to do phiOld[j%nx]. phiOld[j] will always be ok.

Use the square wave initial conditions as well as the cosine bell as it tests how well schemes advect discontinuities.

You will need to consider more diagnostics for the final report.

I would recommend comparing CIP with CTCS as well as with FTBS. Ideally you should attempt to show that it is better than both of these.
